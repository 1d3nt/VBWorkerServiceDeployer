        ''' The <see cref="IServiceInstaller.InstallService"/> method should implement the logic required 
        ''' to install a service, including any necessary configuration and setup steps. The method is 
        ''' expected to return <c>True</c> upon successful installation of the service, indicating that 
        ''' the service has been correctly set up and registered. If the installation fails or encounters 
        ''' issues, the method should return <c>False</c> to signal that the process was not completed 
        ''' successfully. This allows the caller to handle any errors or take appropriate actions based 
        ''' on the success or failure of the service installation.
        ''' </remarks>
