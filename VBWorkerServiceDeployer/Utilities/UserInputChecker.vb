    ''' <summary>
    ''' Provides methods to check user input for application setup decisions.
    ''' </summary>
    ''' <remarks>
    ''' This class implements the <see cref="IUserInputChecker"/> interface and is used to prompt the user for decisions
    ''' regarding the setup of the application, such as whether to proceed with installing a service. It reads user input
    ''' from the console and determines whether the user wants to proceed based on their response.
    ''' 
    ''' The <see cref="UserInputChecker"/> class facilitates interactive setup processes by asking the user for their 
    ''' consent before performing certain actions, ensuring that setup procedures are only executed with user approval.

        ''' <summary>
        ''' Prompts the user to decide whether to proceed with the application setup.
        ''' </summary>
        ''' <returns>
        ''' <c>True</c> if the user inputs 'Y' (case-insensitive) to indicate they want to proceed; otherwise, <c>False</c>.
        ''' </returns>
        ''' <remarks>
        ''' Implementing classes should prompt the user to confirm whether they wish to continue
        ''' with actions such as installing a service. The method reads the user's input from the console or other input
        ''' sources, and returns <c>True</c> if the input is 'Y' (case-insensitive), indicating that the user wants to proceed.
        ''' Any other input will result in <c>False</c>, signaling that the user does not want to proceed.
        ''' 
        ''' The <see cref="ShouldProceed"/> method helps in making runtime decisions based on user feedback and is crucial
        ''' for interactive setup processes where user consent is required before performing certain actions.
        ''' </remarks>
